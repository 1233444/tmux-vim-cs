A freelance journalist says the rescue of a dog trapped under the rubble was 
“a little bright spot” amid the chaos in an Ottawa neighbourhood ravaged by a tornado.

Matt Day was in Dunrobin Friday evening, interviewing residents and trying to get a 
sense of the destruction caused by the twister that ripped through the 
Ottawa-Gatineau area hours earlier.

“Looking around, you could see that homes were just completely totalled; I was talking 
to one family outside of their house and they were telling me their second floor was on 
their front lawn,” said Day, 30.

He said he heard a commotion across the street as he was speaking to families, and 
found out there was a dog _ a beagle named Charlie _ trapped underneath a pile of rubble.

“Someone says, ‘we found a dog under the rubble,’ and you think the worst. I was not 
prepared to go over and see that sight,” he said.

“We didn’t know if it was injured, or anything.”

Day and other members of the media rushed to the scene, some pulling their phones out 
to illuminate the area, which was being rapidly cast into shadow by the setting sun.

“It was that fine line as a journalist. Do you help, or do you do your job?” he said. 
“And at that moment, I felt I could do both.”
