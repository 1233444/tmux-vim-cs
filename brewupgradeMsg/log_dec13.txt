==> ffmpeg@2.8
ffmpeg@2.8 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have ffmpeg@2.8 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ffmpeg@2.8/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/kchan/.bash_profile

For compilers to find ffmpeg@2.8 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ffmpeg@2.8/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ffmpeg@2.8/include"

For pkg-config to find ffmpeg@2.8 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/ffmpeg@2.8/lib/pkgconfig"
